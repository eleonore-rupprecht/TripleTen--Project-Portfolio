# File Title: SuperStore Returns

This was my fifth project in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program! I designed it to showcase my skills in Tableau dashboards and storytelling. The goal was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of Superstore, diving into the reasons behind customer returns and providing insights on how to minimize them.

#### Description:
- 7 Tableau Visualizations, 1 Dashboard, and a 13-page Story Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and Tableau story
  
#### Process:
I first joined the sheets.
Then I analyzed data using visualizations to determine what is causing returns.
I built a dashboard for monitoring returns.
Lastly, I created a Tableau story to present my findings.

#### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item

#### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.	
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.

#### Findings:
- There are several customers with unusually high return rates; Several customers have a return rate of 100%.
- There are several products with unusually high return rates; Several products have a return rate of 100%.
- The location where the order was delivered; Utah being a particular problem.
- Orders are returned significantly more in August with September close behind corresponding with increased purchases.

####Recommendations:
1) Employee training in the technology department to better assist customers in choosing the right product.
2) Reach out to customers with a 100% return rate to determine the reasons behind their decision. Implement any changes needed in our website or shipping partners that are causing these returns.
3) As triage, immediately stop selling the problem products.
4) Focus internal efforts on updating product information, and size guides, and promoting customer reviews via social media collaborations.
5) Consider stricter return policies or charging a return fee for purchases made in problem states.
6) Adjust promotional strategies such as promoting gift cards for holiday peaks, and shifting from discounts to value-added like free shipping.
