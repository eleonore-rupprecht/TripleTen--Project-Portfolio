# File Title: Zomato Customer Analysis

This was my final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program! It was an independent capstone designed to highlight everything I learned throughout the program. The goal was to tackle Zomato's onboarding project and demonstrate my analytical skills to a mock company.

#### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
- 10 pages in Tableau.
- Includes Line charts, Pie charts, bar charts.

#### Process:
I first learned of the problem presented in its entirety and its requirements for approval.
Then, I created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan".
After, I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards in Tableau for a second submission.
Lastly, I presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.

#### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed Excel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.

#### Assumptions:
- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

#### Findings:
1. Customers mostly consist of 23-year-old unmarried men.
2. There is a natural distribution for age however the range is small at 18-34.
3. Women are close behind, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.
4. Zomatoâ€™s customers usually have small family sizes (2-3), educated, but unemployed.
5. Employed customers tend to be below middle class ($50,000/yr).

### Recommendation
1. Targeted Marketing Campaigns:
- Students and Younger Audiences: Continue focusing marketing efforts on students and young adults, as they represent the largest revenue segment. Offer student discounts, loyalty programs, or meal bundles tailored to their preferences.
- Underperforming Segments: Consider initiatives to attract housewives and less educated customers, such as culturally relevant promotions, localized campaigns, or easy-to-use app features.
2. Seasonal Promotions:
Boost engagement during low-performing months like September by launching limited-time offers, collaborations, or themed promotions.
3. Weekend Strategies:
Analyze why customers spend less on weekends and explore potential drivers, such as weekend-specific discounts, delivery perks, or partnerships with entertainment platforms to drive usage.
4. Retention Strategies:
To address the post-2018 decline in sales, invest in customer retention strategies such as subscription-based services, personalized recommendations, or rewards for repeat usage.
5. Expand Employee and Income-Based Offerings:
Tailor products to working professionals and higher-income segments through premium meal options, corporate meal plans, or quick lunch combos.
